# Board Cleanup

Organize and tidy your Trello board by:

1. **Moving completed tasks to Done**
2. **Archiving old completed tasks**
3. **Checking for inactive cards** (not updated in 30+ days)
4. **Reviewing overdue tasks**
5. **Ensuring priorities are aligned**

Regular cleanup keeps your board manageable and helps you focus on active work.
