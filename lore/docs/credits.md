# Credits & Attribution

Lore stands on the shoulders of excellent frameworks. The following projects inspired patterns that were reimplemented in Lore's voice:

## Superpowers

- **TDD workflow** — The test-driven-development skill reimplements the red-green-refactor discipline
- **Brainstorming** — Structured exploration before building
- **Subagent-driven development** — Parallel task execution patterns
- **Systematic debugging** — Methodical bug investigation approach
- **Verification before completion** — Verify before claiming done

## GSD (Get Stuff Done)

- **Lifecycle phases** — Clarify → Plan → Execute → Review workflow
- **Context engineering** — Effective context window management
- **Wave-based parallel execution** — Organizing independent tasks for parallel dispatch

## Loki Mode

- **RARV cycle** — Reason → Act → Reflect → Verify iteration pattern
- **Quality gates** — Checkpoint-based quality enforcement
- **Memory system patterns** — Persistent context across sessions

## SuperClaude

- **Confidence checking** — Pre-implementation readiness assessment
- **Self-check protocol** — Verification rigor

## Personal Plugins

Lore also bundles tools originally developed as standalone plugins:

- **code-intel** — Code exploration and review synthesis
- **feature-research** — Codebase pattern analysis and implementation blueprints
- **no-placeholders** — Stub detection and replacement
- **local-code-review** — Git-free code review
- **productivity** — Standup writing, diff review, code explanation
- **writing-plans** — Structured implementation planning
- **trellio** — Trello project management integration
- **browserx** — Browser automation

All reimplemented patterns are original implementations inspired by the concepts above, not copies of source material.
